HanLTA

Created by Taehee Chang (thchang99@handong.ac.kr)


HanLTA (Handong Live Ticketing Assistant) was created for the purpose of assisting students in the bookings of live ticket sales done frequently at HGU. Ticket booking is done almost exculsively by using an EXCEL sheet, in which by its flexibilty, is a great option. This program means to simplify and optimize the human to machine process in the booking system.

View List
The View List menu shows all students registered currently that exist system. It will show the Student name, their ID, phone number, seat number, and their billing status in a list form. 

Add New
The Add New menu creates a new student profile to enter into the system. It will ask for the Student name, their ID, phone number, seat number, and their billing status to create a comprehensive profile that is required for ticketing.

Find
The Find menu allows users to search for a student profile by their ID or name. Users can enter either the student's ID or their name, and the system will display the corresponding profile if it exists. This feature facilitates quick retrieval of student information for further actions or modifications.

Edit
The Edit menu enables users to modify existing student profiles stored in the system. Users can select a student profile to edit by entering their index from the list. Once the profile is located, users can update any information associated with the student, such as their name, phone number, seat number, or billing status. This functionality provides flexibility for keeping student records accurate and up to date.

Delete
The Delete menu allows users to remove student profiles from the system. Users can specify the student to delete by entering their index from the list. Once the profile is identified, users can confirm the deletion, and the corresponding student record will be permanently removed from the system. 

Seats
The Seats menu provides users with a visual representation of the available seats for live ticketing events. Users can view the seating layout and see which seats are currently occupied and which are available. This feature helps users select seats for booking or navigate through the seating arrangements easily.

Billing
The Billing menu allows users to manage the billing status of student profiles. The billing menu will display all students that have not paid yet. This feature helps keep track of payment statuses for ticket reservations and ensures accurate billing information for each student.

Save
The Save menu enables users to save any modifications or updates made to student profiles back to the system's database. After making changes to student information through menus such as Add New, Edit, or Delete, users can use the Save option to ensure that the changes are permanently stored and reflected in the system's records. 

Final Impressions
Developing HanLTA was a fulfilling experience. Addressing a real need at Handong Global University, I enjoyed creating a tool that simplifies ticket booking. Drawing from personal experiences, I enhanced programming skills and gained valuable insights. Excited to refine HanLTA further, I'm proud of its progress.
